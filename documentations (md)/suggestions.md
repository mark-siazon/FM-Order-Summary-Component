  - For the card `(main.ctn-main)`, I don't see any issue. 
    - You have set a `max-width` to it to prevent it from getting too large. 
    - But, you don't need to set `height: fit-content` since it does not give any effect.

  - For the HTML markup:
    - There is no need to wrap the `<a>` tags and the `image` with `<div>` elements. 
    - Keep the HTML markup as **simple as possible**.

  - Also, I recommend using `<div>` instead of `<section>` tags: 
    - You should not overuse `<section>` or `<article>` elements
    - Since they can create unnecessary noises to screen reader users. 
    - Also, they don't have meaning. 
      - They only have meanings when they are labeled — [ WebAIM: HTML Semantics and Accessibility Cheat Sheet.](https://webaim.org/resources/htmlcheatsheet/)
